                    <p>Tablets are a great addition to your studio equipment and life as a student in general. With them being small and light enough to carry just about anywhere, they are an excellent everyday tool for studio work, tutorials and lectures. In our opinion an iPad’s our favorite product, but there are many more to choose from. </p>
                    <p> Dedicated drawing tablets are also an extremely useful tool and highly adaptable for a surprisingly large amount of architectural tasks.</p>
